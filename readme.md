# Database Engineer Capstone Project

<p>
  In this capstone project, I have designed and implemented a database for the <b>Little Lemon Restaurant</b> using an ER diagram and MySQL. In addition, I have added a sale report feature and created a table booking system to enhance the restaurant's operations. 
</p>
<p>
  I have also leveraged data analytics and visualization techniques to gain insights into the restaurant's performance. Lastly, I developed a database client to provide a user-friendly interface for managing the restaurant's data. 
</p>
<p>
  Overall, my project demonstrated my proficiency in <b>database design, development, and analysis,<b/> with a focus on meeting the needs of a real-world business.
